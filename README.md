# Turn Based Strategy Config

Public repository for the TBS config. Any configuration on the main branch will be downloaded automatically into the game client when a user navigates to the right menu.

For developing and testing purposes, it is possible to test on a branch and configure your game client to utilise the dev branch. When development and testing is complete please open a PR using the template to merge into main and make the game changes live.
